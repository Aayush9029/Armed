A **menu builder** and **suite of SwiftUI controls** that closely mimic the feel of **macOS Control Center** menus.

Integrates seamlessly with Swift's new `MenuBarExtra`.

Both **Dark** and **Light Mode** are fully supported.

## Getting Started

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

1. Add MacControlCenterUI as a dependency using Swift Package Manager.

   - In an app project or framework, in Xcode:

     Select the menu: **File ‚Üí Swift Packages ‚Üí Add Package Dependency...**

     Enter this URL: `https://github.com/orchetect/MacControlCenterUI`

   - In a Swift Package, add it to the Package.swift dependencies:

     ```swift
     .package(url: "https://github.com/orchetect/MacControlCenterUI", from: "2.0.0")
     ```

2. Import the library:

   ```swift
   import MacControlCenterUI
   ```

3. Try the [Demo](Demo) example project to see all of the available controls in action.

## Requirements

Minimum requirements to compile: Xcode 13 on macOS 11 Big Sur or newer.

Supports macOS 11.0+ once compiled.

## Known Issues

Due to the lacklustre implementation of Apple's `MenuBarExtra`, it is currently not possible to get smooth window resize animations without a tremendous amount of work. For that reason, most MacControlCenterUI controls whose Control Center counterparts use animation will instead use safer static view size changes.
